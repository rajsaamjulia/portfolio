summary: "In the digital media environment, attention will most probably continue to be used as a success metric and a currency in a business context even if the ways of the attention economy will change in the future. In order to find a way a more inclusive, ‘holistic’ way of tracking attention as a designer and convey more than time spent, number of visitors or bounce rate, I experimented with visually representing attention as building a relationship between subject and object."

# Visual representation of attention
#### to show its relational nature instead of using it as a currency

In the digital media environment, attention will most probably continue to be used as a success metric and a currency in a business context even if the ways of the attention economy will change in the future. In order to find a way a more inclusive, ‘holistic’ way of tracking attention as a designer and convey more than time spent, number of visitors or bounce rate, I experimented with visually representing attention as building a relationship between subject and object, including external distractions and interruptions (internal ones, due to my lack of ability to interview without disturbing, or mind-reading, are excluded).
Does something catch the bottom-up perception or is top-down control necessary to focus on that object? What emotions are visible on the observed person? Is she excited, active or calm and passive?

First by observation and improvising on the spot, then independently visualizing mental processes, I came up with the visual solution above. While the line quality is meaningful, the color choices at this point are arbitrary.
The final diagram was inspired by Gazzaley, Adam, and Larry D. Rosen: The Distracted Mind–Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World & Clifford Nass, Corina Yen: The Man Who Lied to His Laptop, chapter 4.

After coming up with the diagram, I started to use it during observation by picking one subject at a time and noting not just the object of their focus but also how forced their focus appeared and what emotions could I detect during these short time periods.

The first scene was the staircase of the Unimail building at the University of Geneva, where students casually sit down and chat or work together. It is a quiet but social place.

The next scene was the library, where deep individual sustained focus is the norm.

Conferences (and shows, lectures, etc) are places of joint attention. The speaker tries to perceive all the audience...

... while individual members of the audience sometimes switch quickly between the talk and something else.

As the malls overwhelm by competing for people's senses with advertisements, it was impossible to pick one subject and object; I tried to depict the general cacophony instead.

The project has its limitations:  only the visible distractions and interruptions can be observed, and an interview would disturb the subject's attentional state. The diagram is not yet at a phase where it could be practically used. Still, a simple coloured line already conveys more information than merely counting time spent.
