summary: "Nowadays we live and work in many different places. We are always packing and unpacking bags for the office, the gym or the airport. It is stressful to keep all of your things in mind and painful to forget something. For this reason, we have developed ShuQi, to make things follow you. ShuQi allows you to organize your life in packing lists and scan your bag instantly for the most important items. You can leave your home or office without worries. Project done as part of [chi.camp](chi.camp) at HEAD Genève, in collaboration with EPFL."
