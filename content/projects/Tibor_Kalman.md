summary: "A poster in memory of the famous graphic designer Tibor Kalman. I chose to represent all the colleagues and clients around him, who were influenced by his unique attitude towards design and thus carried on the \"Tibor Kalman-meme\" (like Stefan Sagmeister, Adbusters, the colleagues at Colors magazine, including Oliviero Toscani). The casual handwriting and manual execution is chosen with the same attitude that Kalman advocated for: 'undesign'."

A poster in memory of the famous graphic designer Tibor Kalman. I chose to represent all the colleagues and clients around him, who were influenced by his unique attitude towards design and thus carried on the "Tibor Kalman-meme" (like Stefan Sagmeister, Adbusters, the colleagues at Colors magazine, including Oliviero Toscani). The casual handwriting and manual execution is chosen with the same attitude that Kalman advocated for: "undesign". Each name is researched and checked.
