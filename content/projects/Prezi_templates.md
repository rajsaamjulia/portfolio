When creating a new presentation, many users prefer templates. It is important to provide them with easy-to-use quality starting points. Metaphor: ‘the road ahead’.

Creating a prezi template is a challenging task, as one really has to understand the medium and set a visual framework. There are two main goals: the template should have space for the user’s story and content, but it should be rigid enough that non-designers will also produce a visually professional experience. We had design principles to keep us focused and help the consultations and critique sessions while designing these templates.

The *Maze* is a one-way straightforward template, while the *Voyage* is more flexible thanks to its rearrangeable, resizable and duplicable elements.
