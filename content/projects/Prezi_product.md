# Viewer Lite – Embed

![image](/img/Prezi/product/001_embed.png)

The embedded Prezi Viewer Lite was our first directly implemented project. This software enables to view prezis on another platform without leaving the webpage, eg. view a prezi on the New York Times mobile site. Since its launch, the mobile views greatly increased.

# Sharing - conceptual redesign suggestion

## Brief

### 1. Objectives

This project aims to review the Share Dialog across the whole product and design a new version that accommodates all the necessary functions in a clear structure. It is a very complex function with deep connections to other features and functions of the product, so it required thorough research to find the root causes of the problems before thinking about solutions.

Presentations are tools of communication that need to be shown. How this is enabled is crucial to make users feel confident and in control when using the product.

**Many confidential info is missing on this page, that's why there are empty headers, etc.**


#### Methodology:

Collect and summarize the existing research in the company and answer the questions inspired by these documents.
Look at competitor’s solutions and best practices.
Select the problems we want to solve and the opportunities we can build on.
Draw wireframes, then design mockups for layout ideas.
Create a prototype (completed with Sketch & Framer.js)
Present our proposal to the product design team.

#### The results are:

PDF and prezi documentations of the research
Tailor the design principles to evaluate our progress
Sketch mockups for layout ideas
Clickable prototype, completed with Framer.js, that we handed over with the documentation.

### 2. Key personas
We used the Prezi personas that were relevant according to the user journey.

### 3. Scenarios

## Analysis

### 1. Consultation with the UX researchers
Collect and summarize the existing research in the company.

### 2. The problem history
We investigated whether there were any inconsistencies in the design, and if the function fits to the user’s mental model.

### 3. User interview

### 4. Journey map

## Problem Statements
We used the so called “5 Why’s” technique to discover where the problems stem from. After that, we collected suggestions for improvement answering the question “How might we…?” We aimed to reduce the number of mistakes and to make it easy to recover from them.

## Conclusion:
The users will accidentally publish their prezis. By making it more visible what is PRIVATE, what is PUBLIC, we can avoid this issue.

## IV. Design

### 1. Design Principles
Tailoring the company’s existing principles to this project.

### 2. Design Solutions for 2 main points:

How might we give rights to collaborators?
How might we prevent accidental publishing?

#### 1. Low-fidelity wireframes
#### 2. Digital wireframes
#### 3. Mockups
#### 4. Prototype

Here are a few of the screens:
